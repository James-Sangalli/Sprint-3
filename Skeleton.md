What happens to the layout when you resize the screen to less than 550 px. How do you think that works?

The layout changes to that suited for a mobile device, this works by setting a different @media attribute set to a different
min-width characteristic. In this scenario if your screen resized to less than 550px you would set off the @media attribute
where the min-width is set to 400px but less than the 550px @media attribute.
